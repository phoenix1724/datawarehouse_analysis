📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a Data Warehouse using SQL to uncover valuable business insights. The analysis includes data exploration, performance evaluation, segmentation, and reporting on customers and products.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of SQL in Business Intelligence (BI) by performing advanced analytical techniques on structured warehouse data.

🔎 Key Analysis Performed

Database Exploration – Understanding the schema, tables, and relationships in the data warehouse.

Dimension Exploration – Examining dimensions such as customers, products, employees, and time for deeper insights.

Date Range Exploration – Filtering and analyzing data across different time periods for trends.

Measures Exploration – Identifying and evaluating key metrics like sales, revenue, orders, and payments.

Magnitude Analysis – Assessing the absolute scale of measures (e.g., top sales, total orders).

Ranking Analysis – Ranking customers, products, and categories by sales performance.

Change Over Time Analysis – Tracking variations in sales and customer behavior over time.

Cumulative Analysis – Building running totals and cumulative measures for growth patterns.

Performance Analysis – Evaluating KPIs (e.g., revenue growth, customer retention, product line success).

Data Segmentation – Splitting data into meaningful groups (e.g., customer segments, product categories, regional offices).

Part of Whole Analysis – Measuring contributions of individual entities to overall business performance (e.g., product line share of total sales).

📊 Reports Generated

Customer Report → Insights into customer demographics, order frequency, and revenue contribution.

Product Report → Analysis of product performance, product line distribution, and sales contribution.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

SQL → For querying and analysis.

Data Warehouse → As the central source for structured business data.

Business Intelligence Concepts → To apply structured analysis methodologies.

🚀 Outcome

The project provides a comprehensive SQL-based analytical framework for data warehouses, enabling better decision-making through segmentation, trend detection, and performance measurement.
